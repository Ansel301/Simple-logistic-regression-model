Use C++ to implement a simple logistic regression model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on a dataset. The data preprocessing steps include replacing missing data with the feature's average, and data standardization.

The dataset contains:
1. Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. BMI: Body mass index
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age: Age (years)
9. Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0
